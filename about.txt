Root directory of the game project. Fill in all the details here about how the game is linking to the engine, where the engine is, and what anyone would need to be able to actually compile and use this template here. This should be like the README for the project, just without any markdown, and honestly, converting all of this to a README format would be a really great practice.

== How to set up a new Project ==
The Project.vcxproj is a generic set up for Visual Studio 2019. It links to Tower, and copies any changed headers directly into this project. This is convenient, but required some manual set up.

1. Open Project.vcxproj

2. Update the RootNamespace to be the name of the new project.

3. Update the TargetName to be the name of the new project. Prefer all lower case. This will be the name of the .exe that is created to run the game at the end. There are 4 places in the .vcxproj file that will need to be updated, and they are relatively close together.

4. Update the GUID for the project. Use the command `uuidgen` on a windows command prompt.

5. Open the .vscode/launch.json. Update the "program" command to be the new .exe file that is created by the project.
