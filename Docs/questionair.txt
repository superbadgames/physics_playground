You just won a mega-million-dollar jackpot in the lottery! You’ve cleared your to-do list and taken a 3 month vacation at a series of your favorite cities and resorts. You return happy, rested and all caught up in every phase of your life. There’s no to-do list for work, and nothing at home that needs to be cleaned, straightened, fixed, watered, painted, re-arranged or put away. You no longer need to work, nor does your spouse or partner. If you have kids, however, they still attend the same grade of school and they still have to do their homework. Some things can’t be changed by money! From this moment on you can do whatever you want to do each day. In this “perfect world’ how would you spend the first month when you got back?

A magical genie has decided to reward you for all the good deeds you have done. You are transported back to your old home, the place where you lived when you were twelve years old. It is late in the night and everyone else is asleep. You are not alone in the room. Sitting across from you is your 12 year old self. Even though you are both the same person, the adult you and the 12 year old you can talk to each other in the same way that any two people can talk. The genie will allow you to tell your 12 year old self three things about your grown up life and see how “the younger you” reacts at age 12. Tomorrow morning, the 12 year old version of you will have no memory of this conversation. But, for tonight you can share three things that you would have most wanted to know back then about your future life. And you’ll get to see how you as a child would react to knowing these three facts. What three details about your life do you share? How does 12 year old you respond?
